# Exercises from Francois Chollet's "Deep Learning with Python"

This repo contains exercises, sample code and experiments derived from the book "Deep Learning with Python". As I read through this (wonderful) book I am typing out all of the code
samples and doing the suggested "Futher experiments". (Yes, yes, I know that fchollet has all the code online in his github repo, but years ago a friend told me that your memory is in your elbow (i.e. the act of writing something helps to internalize it) and I think there is something to that idea.
